RAGDOLLS GAME (“KITTEN RAGDOLLS GAME” or “we”) is dedicated to protecting 
the privacy rights of our online users (“users” or “you”). This Privacy 
Policy has been crafted to inform you as to the ways we collect, store, 
use, and manage the information you provide in connection with any Era’s
 game or Application. Please note that the scope of this Privacy Policy 
is limited to only information collected from KITTEN RAGDOLLS GAME through
 use of the Service. By using the service, you are agreeing to the 
collection and use of your personal information as outlined in this 
Privacy Policy. We may amend the Privacy Policy from time to time, and 
we encourage you to consult the Privacy Policy regularly for change.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">COLLECT INFORMATION</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">When
 you use any KITTEN RAGDOLLS GAME Service, also sometimes referred to as 
an “Application” or “App”, you get access to its online community within
 that Service and you allow KITTEN RAGDOLLS GAME to access certain 
information about you. The information you allow us to access varies by 
Application, and it is affected by the privacy settings you and your 
friends establish in that Application. Users can always refuse to supply
 personal identification information, except that it may prevent them 
from engaging in certain App related activities.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">There are two types of information we may collect through your use of our:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">1.

address, email address, telephone number, photograph, precise 
geolocation information (i.e., your specific location), Era’s game 
player ID, credit card information and, in some cases, usernames.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">2.
 “Non-Personal Information”, which is information that does not identify
 you and cannot be used to contact you personally, including information
 about you such as your date of birth, age, ZIP code, non-precise 
geolocation information (e.g., your city), and gender, as well as 
information about your computer and mobile device, such as your unique 
device ID, Internet Protocol (IP) address, or other persistent 
identifiers, and their hardware/software/firmware. Non-Personal 
Information also includes “Usage Data“, which is anonymous data tied to 
your computer and/or device, such as the actions you take within and 
outside of the Websites/Apps, the browser you use, the identity of other
 Apps included on your device, the date and time of your use of the 
Websites/Apps, your game progress, play time, score and achievements, 
and the URLs you visited and/or Apps you used before and after using our
